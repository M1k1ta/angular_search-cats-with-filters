---INTRODUCTION---
Hello. I created this test task for about 10-12 hours. When I did this task I learned new for me technologies, such as RxJS, NgXS, and Angular Material. Before this task, I don't know about these technologies. But I think I ideally used these technologies in this task. 

---TECHNOLOGIES---
Angular, Angular Material, Reactive Forms, RxJS, NgX & SCSS.
I also used chat GPT and google to find the necessary information.

---DEVELOPMENT PROCESS---
I got this test task in the evening on Friday. At first, I started googling about new technologies for me. I read about Reactive Programing and NgXS. And in the same time, I created an empty project.

I relaxed on Saturday.

On Sunday I coded. I created Markap and add a few styles. I got data using API(https://thecatapi.com/), I read documentation to know how to use this API. I created methods that help me get breeds and cats. I used these methods and did this task working. But I used the button to form and didn't use RxJS, NgXS, and Angular Material. So after I started adding to project RxJS and NgXS. I read about it before, but the first time I don't sure how to use these technologies. So chat GPT helped me. Chat GPT sometimes helped me, and sometimes I tell him his error. I added RxJS and NgXS and the button in the form was removed. Because use reactive programming with reactive form after changing values in the form I get data from the server using new filter values.

After, I added a router to save breed and limit in the URL.
And at the end, I thought about how to add Angular Material. And It was my big mistake. Because Angular Material is a library that gives ready components with styles. I didn't want to spend more time changing the markup. So I solve add Angular Material only to select.
